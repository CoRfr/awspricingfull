On-Demand and Reserved pricing schemes covered both for previous and current generation instance types. Contains the most recent updates (new EC2 Reservation pricing scheme, D2 instances and more).\r\n\r\nModule is designed to retrieve the AWS prices for \r\nfour major AWS services that have reserved instances involved: EC2, ElastiCache, \r\nRDS and Redshift. The prices either On-Demand or Reserved (specified by user) can \r\nbe retrieved to Command Line in JSON, Table (Prettytable) or CSV formats. CSV format \r\noption also saves the csv file to the folder specified by user, which is the main \r\nuse case.\r\n\r\nThe module also contains the class which consolidates all the pricing data into a single structured JSON, Table or CSV output: all 4 services, reserved and On-Demand.\r\n\r\nThe undocumented AWS pricing APIs are used as the sources. The same APIs  serve\r\nthe data to the AWS pricing pages.\r\n\r\nBoth current and previous generation instance prices are retrieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore information and description of classes contained in the module can be found in Sphinx documentation HTML located at https://github.com/ilia-semenov/awspricingfull/tree/master/docs_html folder.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
